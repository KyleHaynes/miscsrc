/*! libmisc 
 *#	A library of miscellaneous C functions I've written over time.
 *#
 *# Each of these modules is a combination of C source and header files.
 *{
 ** {*regex*} - A simple regular expression pattern matcher.
 ** {*hash*} - A simple hash table implementation.
 ** {*ini*} - A parser for {*.ini*} configuration files.
 ** {*eval*} - A mathematical expression evaluator.
 ** {*simil*} - Compares the {/similarity/} of two strings.
 ** {*list*} - A generic linked list implementation with extra helper functions.
 ** {*csv*} - A set of functions to read, write and manipulate Comma Separated Values (CSV) files.
 ** {*getarg*} - An alternative to {{getopt()}} for platforms without it (like WIN32). 
 ** {*utils*} - A couple of utility functions.
 *}
 *=
 *# These modules have been written to conform to ANSI C and to be platform 
 *# independent. If you have any problems compiling them with a standard C
 *# compiler, please feel free to contact the author.
 *#
 *=
 *# Effort has been made to keep the modules independent of each other (with
 *# some minor exceptions), so that the individual files can be copied to other 
 *# projects if you don't want to link your project to the {*libmisc*} library.
 *#
 *=
 *# HTML documentation is created through the {{doc.awk}} Awk script, hence the
 *# funny glyphs in the header and {{README}} files.
