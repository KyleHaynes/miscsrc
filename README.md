A library of miscellaneous C functions I've written over time.

The modules include: A simple regular expression pattern matcher,
* A simple hash table implementation,
* A parser for __INI__ configuration files,
* A mathematical expression evaluator,
* A function that compares the _similarity_ of two strings,
* A generic linked list implementation with extra helper functions,
* A set of functions to read, write and manipulate __Comma Separated Values__ (CSV) files,
* A mark-and-sweep garbage collector,
* An alternative to `getopt()` called `getarg()` for platforms without _getopt()_ (meant for WIN32) and
* A couple of utility functions.
